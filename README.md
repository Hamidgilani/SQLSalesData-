# SQLSalesData-
This a portfolio project in which I have used SQL to analyse sales data 

This project is a replication of [Walmart Sales Analysis by Princekrampah](https://github.com/Princekrampah/WalmartSalesAnalysis/tree/master)  

The project aims to understand which products are performing well, which stores and which regions are good at sales, sales trends of different products, and customer behaviour. The purpose of this project is mainly to understand different factors that affect sales data. This would enable us to gain insights and improve and optimize our sales decisions.  

This is just one way to explore data sets and see where we can find relationships between variables. The whole purpose of this exercise is to explore this dataset in SQL
